# Answer that MODem

AMUL comes from the days of direct dial-up and bulletin boards, and generally
BBS software was what answered incoming connections for you.

With emerging inter-bbs communications such as FidoNet, you needed a way to
detect whether an incoming call was a user or a remote server.

A lot of boards only supported single-users and single-modems, which wasn't
much help to AMUL. I'd also written file- and mail-networking programs for
a few systems (BBS-PC!, StarNet and Paragon).

So I wrote AMOD to act as a bootstrap that would allow negotitation of the
answering systems' role: bbs, MUD or operator-defined.

I don't know what the final state of it was because I wasn't able to get to
a position to have my BBS answer to lines at once :(
