; System Message file.
;
; This file lets the game developer define strings for all of the built-in
; instances where the game needs to send text to the players.
;
; For legacy reasons, each System Message is named "$1" thru "$75".
;
; If the first line of the body of a message is indented, the same indent
; will be removed from subsequent lines.
