; The comment line before the ranks gives you a rough idea what each of the
; fields is. Just as a reminder:
;
;	male		male-rank name
;	female		female-rank name (put = if same as male)
;	score		minimum score to attain this rank
;	str		default strength
;	stamina		default stamina
;	dext		default dexterity
;	wsdm		default wisdom
;	exp		level of experience achieved
;	mag		magic points given initially
;	g		maximum grammes carried
;	obj		maximum no. of objects carried
;	pkill		points for killing someone of this level
;	task		Task required to achieve this level
;	prompt		Default is '>' - prompt for a command input
;			(note, if the prompt includes a space, use quotes)
; To put a space in a rank name, use an underscore (eg Bold_Hero)
; If female-rank = male-rank, put '=' in the female rank (unless you WANT to
; type it out in full again)
; To put a space in/after a prompt, place quotes around the prompt.
; * MAX LENGTH OF A PROMPT IS 16 CHARACTERS *

; Regarding stats:
; The meaning of stats I'd seen in different games was confusing, and I think it would be
; better for these to have a well defined set of defaults but actually otherwise let the
; designer have full control over how many stats their game has and what they each mean.
;
; This could easily be facilitated by having some general "mechanic" VM instructions
; that expose formulae the designer can fill out.

; formula=chance-to-hit with attacker and target:
;   attacker.dexterity - target.defense / 100 * target.dexterity
