Starting room.
Harsh green light illuminates this room in a way that gives you an urge to
cosplay Mr Anderson from the matrix. A hall leads south to somewhere else.

room=hall
	Hallway.
	With a greenish room to the north and a blueish room to the south, it is
	something of a relief that the room to the west looks quiet and uninteresting.

room=quietplace silent
	Quiet and uninteresting room.
	Non-descript would be the word you were looking for if you weren't already wondering 'is it quiet in here?'

room=endroom
	Blue room.
	This spacious room is various shades of blue, all of which seem pleasant. The hallway to your north isn't blue,
	and the tiny room to the east is a dark litle cubbyhole that may or may not be blue.

; Small limits number of players who can enter the room to 1 at a time
; dark means no self-illumination
; sanctuary means you get points for any objects you drop here
room=cubby small dark sanctuary
	Cubby hole.
	You've forced yourself into a space barely large enough for a cut's meow, never mind swinging the cat, but at least you have a light source so you can appreciate the accomplishment. Be aware this is a REALLY small room and you are taking up most of it.

	Limbo.
	Indistinct white mists swirl around you and an insensetive breeze blows at you in no actual direction. This place is nowhere.
