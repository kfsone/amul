* Tests on amulcom.strings.c

- memory allocation
- use skip functions instead of replace
- nacp/ncop -> structures like C++
- bools
- eliminate warnings

Done in the .txt files, these need converting in code,
but also they need some better names; perhaps '$x' would
be better and more consistent for those that are builtins.

"travel -> .travel
"magsleep -> .magsleep
"rankX -> .rankX
"greet -> .greet
"boot -> .boot
"pre-magic -> .pre-magic
"start -> .start
"get -> .get
"burnme -> .burnme
"needtwo -> .needtwo
"drop -> .drop

- Check EXPECT_ERROR(EINVALs and make sure we're testing individual
  invalid values rather than possible occlusions.

- Normlize 'number of entry' value in structs to counts, size, or length
- Replace C&A with a simpler VM model,
- Replace negative actions (rooms) with a GOTO instruction,
- Use [] instead of *ptr,
- Collapse multiple files into single file with compound records,
- Leverage "write-reserve" model to populate partial records:
	size_t size = 0;
	size_t countPosn = ftell(ofp);
	fwrite(&size, sizeof(count), ofp);
	readEntry();
	size = sizeOfData();
	frewriteAt(countPosn, &size, sizeof(size), ofp);
- replace 'sex' with gender
- replace _TT_ENT with { verb, vtab }
- rename "task" -> "goal" or "achievement"
