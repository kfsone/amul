Look.

I was young, I didn't get enough sleep, entirely self-taught, and a lot scared.

Most of all, I was overwhelmed and confused by the fact that simple little me
could write a thing that let me create a thing that let someone play a game.

So there are exclamation marks everywhere...

The documentation is a mess, since I appear to have dumped two sets of
versions into one folder when I was packing up my Amiga.

Sorry =/

You'll want to compare the "README" files and pick one. But you may actually
find the SMUGL documentation more helpful.
