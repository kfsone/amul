             MSGS.DOC - Messages (Files SysMsg.TXT and UMsg.TXT)
             ---------------------------------------------------


 In Lang.TXT and Travel.TXT, you will regularily want to send a response to
the user, telling them why things didn't work, or what they did. You will also
want to tell other users of changes in the world. For example, when the user
opens a door, anyone else within range of the door needs to know that it has
BEEN opened.

 The general command to send a message to the user is "message" or "reply".
This is followed by one of three parameters. Either a text string enclosed in
double or single quotes ("..." or '...'), or a User Message ID (UMsg) or a
System Message ID (SysMsg). [Note: There are OTHER messageing commands!]

 When a string is a single line, one-off message, then it is best to put it
directly into the Lang or Travel.TXT file. However, once it gets over one
line, or if its used regularily, you should use the message file method.


 AMUL has two message files. One contains messages which are required by the
AMUL frame itself; such as "Enter your name: " and various others. By not
having all these prompts and responses built into AMUL, the program size is
reduced, and the AMUL programmer has greater control! This is the SysMsg.TXT
file.

 The second file is UMsg.TXT. This holds any messages that you may want to
use in your adventure. The bulk of these messages will be responses like
"You'll have to stand up first." or "But there's no-one else here!?!".

 All system message ID's consist of a dollar sign ($) followed by the
message number. UMsgs can have any text label you want. So you might have
one called 'NoOneHere'. An example SysMsg ID is $31 which is "It is now too
dark to see."

 Before we explain the message files, there are a few conventions that you
should know about...

 When constructing a message, you will often want to say "The thing you just
talked about isn't here." So if the player types "Get Box" and there is no
box about, you will most likely want to say "The box isn't here!". Rather
than having to have a different message for each object, AMUL lets you put
a three character codes which display the contents of different 'variables'.
These are called escape codes, and consist of an AT (@) followed by two
characters. An example is @me which displays the players name. @ge is replaced
with the players gender (male or female). So you could say:
	"Hello, @me, did you know you are @ge?".
when AMUL outputs this to a user, it might become:
	"Hello, Fred, did you know you are female?"

 These are explained in more detail in ESC.Doc.

 If the last character in a message is an open brace ({) then AMUL won't
automatically print a carriage return at the end of it. An example of this
is the system message to ask a user to enter his password ($12). To have
	Enter your password: <password>
rather than
	Enter your password:
	<password>
you would define message $12 as "Enter your password: {".

 If you want an empty line in your messages, you MUST remember to put a space
or a period (.) at the beginning, otherwise you will end the message...

 This applies to ALL three kinds of messages!


                                1)  UMsg.TXT
                                ------------

---Start---UMsg.TXT---Start---
[msgid=](id)
:	<text>
----End----UMsg.TXT----End----

Notes: The <text> can be as many lines long as you want. We recommend that
after you have written the text, that you indent it using a single tab. When
you later come to look through the file, you will find it much easier to read.

Examples:
---Start---UMsg.TXT---Start---

; Again, comments are allowed...

msgid=NotGot
	You aren't carrying it anyway!

; @vb is replaced with the verb the player typed, e.g. "get".
msgid=CantDoThat
	You can't @vb that!

TheMsg
A magical force prevents you from entering the corridor, and you find yourself
filled to the brim with ingenious ideas for your own multi-user game... Why
not put finger to keyboard and begin your own AMUL adventure?
----End----UMsg.TXT----End----



                               2)  SysMsg.TXT
                               --------------

---Start---SysMsg.TXT---Start---
[msgid=]$<msgno>
:	<text>
----End----SysMsg.TXT----End----

Notes: The messages MUST be listed in order, and ALL messages MUST exist!

System Messages are constructed in the same way as UMsg's, except for the
ID's... See the STD sysmsg.txt for examples. Below is a list of ALL System
messages, along with where they are used, and an example message.
