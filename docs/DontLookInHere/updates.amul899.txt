[0.8.93]

* Fixed some HORRIBLE glitches in AMULCOM'S processing of Travel.Txt
* Fixed AMULCOM so that its FAR more flexible with comments.
* Fixed the software failure which happened with '*' comments in Travel.Txt!
* AMAN will no longer die if there are no objects in the adventure.
* Various minor modifications to internal workings of AMAN & AMULCOM.
* AMUL will now ask new users if they want to adjust their settings
  (screen width, ansi, redo-character, etc)
* Minor internal changes to AMUL itself.
* __ THE SOFTWARE FAIL IN AMUL'S SERIAL HANDLER WAS DEFINITELY FIXED in 891 __
  (it's not recurred since)
* Removed some 'upgrade' code left in from version 0.8.18 (about 1ks worth)

[0.8.94]

* Fixed some HORRENDOUS glitches in AMULCOM'S treatment of comments!
* Comments can now be placed just about anywhere (although they effectively
  end the current line)
* Various minor fixes

[0.8.95]

* Various tiny polishes
* New ESCape code .. @ve .. Unlike @VB which displays the verb which the
  PLAYER ENTERED @VE displays the verb set by the last treatas.
* Minor feature: LOOK command now tells TopRank players the super-go name of
  each location!
* Version 1.0 of AMUL-Ed - the User-Editor - nearing completion, a few minor
  alterations and it'll be ready! (Total coding time to date: 4 hrs 52 mins)

[0.8.96]

* Fixed a small problem in AMAN which slowly ate system memory ...
* Cured a bug in SendAT (Sends text to the serial port) which wasted 128
  bytes of memory each time the program ran.

	* --v MAJOR NOTE v-- *

   AMAN will now look for a script file called 'Reset.Bat'. This file must
   be _IN THE DIRECTORY WHICH AMAN IS LOADED FROM_. If this file exists AMAN
   will execute it after EACH reset. A sample reset.bat is included.
 
	* --^ MAJOR NOTE ^-- *
* Fixed a bug where AMUL was case insensitive to words with an 'A' in them!

[0.8.99]

* Increased maximum number of lines possible to 14.
* Implemented GLOBAL daemons! PLEASE READ THE FILE MAJOR.NOTE.
* Implemented Global Daemon processor.
* New special command "boot. This is executed by the global daemon processor
  as a kind of startup command.
* New condition: in <room> <object> .. tests is <object> in a certain room
* New action: gstart <daemon> <time> -- activates global daemon
* Increased efficency of Daemon timers. (30% less processor usage overall!)
* "action others <text>" only sends to text those nearby who can SEE you!
* AMULCom now REQUIRES Mobiles.Txt to complete compilation. The file need
  not contain any data, but MUST exist.
* Two new 'labels':
	*<object>	-	location of object
	#<player>	-	rank of player
* Improved 'count down' display function. When you display '@re', the
  format should be better, and the same for a daemon-counter!
* Minor increase in speed
* Minor internal changes thru a change of compile-time command lines.
* Minor changes to AMan - compiled with new command line.
* Memory fragmentation greatly reduced.
* AMan command line bug fixed: Drive or Path names are now PROPERLY accepted;
	aman df1:	was treated as aman df1:/
	aman df1:adv/	was treated as aman df1:adv//
  both instances now fixed.
* AMan command line: Added '-s[path]' option. Allows you to specify a new
  game to be loaded after next reset...
* Change to AMUL.Log layout:
  AMan messages are now indicated by (#) instead of a line number.
  AMan message types now more organised: The two letter types are:
	Prefix	Meaning
	  ##	Start-Game
	  >>	Shutdown/Reset Request Received
	   <	All users disconnected (Reset)
	  <<	Reset completed
	  **	General Error (ShutDown request denied or setup error)
	  ->	User Connected
	  <-	User Disconnected
	  []	User Achieved Top-Rank
	  @@	User-Logged Transaction (from game etc).
  This should allow you to keep a better track of whats happening in ya log!
* AMULCom: 'Label' bug... Trying to say "IF value IS >label" would produce
  an error. This is now fixed, so lines such as: "if myrank >#player" or
  "if rand 10 <myrank" are now acceptable.
* Doccumentation updated.
* AMULCom: Fixed a bug with
	syntax player noun
 or	syntax text player  etc ...

* New Action/Announcement groups:

	action CANSEE "text"   - send text to only those who can see me
	announce NOTSEE "text" - send only to those HERE who CANT see me
* Various changes to the combat routines to improve fight quality.
* Changes to the way that rank-changes are made.
* Fixed a bug whereby certain conditions would return stray values!
  (inc, dec, fire, lit, magic etc)
* Revamped the COMBAT function. The fights should be more interesting now!

******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************
 New  escape  codes:   @xx  &  @xy.  These are used in interaction sitautions
 where you want to send different text to users depending on whether they can
 or  can't  see  you.   There  are  several reasons these are needed:  If the
 player is in a dark room, others nearby can't see him so wouldn't know, say,
 WHO had performed an action.  However, if the player was invivisble, certain
 players  wouldn't  be  able to see him, whilst others MIGHT.  This obviously
 causes  a  certain amount of confusion and the conditions and actions to get
 around  it  seemed  pointless  when  all that would change was perhaps 'Fred
 burps' becomes 'Someone nearby burps'.

 The result of @xx and @xy is changed depending on the RECEIVER of the text.

 @xx is used for 'players name', @xy is for 'players name [and rank]'

	same room	same room	diff room	diff room
	visible to	! visible	< top-rank	top-rank
	---------------------------------------------------------
@xx:
act.:	player's name	Someone nearby	Someone		Someone very powerful
ann.:	player's name	Someone nearby	Someone		Someone
@xy:
ann.:	@me the @mr	Someone nearby
					A powerful @gn voice in the distance
							A @gn voice in the distance
ann.:	@me the @mr	A @gn voice nearby
					A powerful @gn voice in the distance
							A @gn voice in the distance

Using  these codes you can produce very good interactive code with a minimum
of effort.
