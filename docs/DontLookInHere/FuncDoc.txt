  General notes
  -------------

When talking to AMUL in the Language table, you can use various labels to
refer to the internal variables, and the components of the sentence.
The words adj1, noun1, prep, adj2 and noun2 refer to the seperate words in
the sentence... A quick example:
	"get the brown dog"	adj1=brown, noun1=dog
	"put bat in red box"	adj1=none, noun1=bat, prep=in
				adj2=red,  noun2=box

You can refer to the different words by refering to them using the same
labels as you used in your syntax line.
To demonstrate, here are a few ways of telling AMUL how to understand the
basic 'give obj to player' command:

	verb=give
	syntax=verb noun player
		always give noun1 to noun2
		always give noun to player
		always give noun1 to player

Any of the valid 'types' can be used as labels. However, in the situation
where you have two of the same type, e.g. "verb player player", you must
suffix the SECOND reference with its number (e.g. player2).

The above can be used wherever the <noun> label indicator is used.

The label <msg> refers to either (i) a UMsg label, or (ii) a text string
in quotes ("...").

To display one of the players variables, there are several 'escape' seqeunces
you can put in <msg> texts, i.e. UMSG's, System Messages, or text strings.
These are: (See Esc.Doc for a FULLY UPTO DATE list)
	@me		my name
	@mr		my rank's name
	@gn		my gender (male or female)
	@ge		he or she depending on sex
	@go		his or her depending on sex
	@gh		him or her depending on sex
	@vb		current verb
	@n1		noun1
	@n2		noun2
	@a1		adjective 1
	@a2		adjective 2
	@pp		PrePosition
	@v1		Value of noun1
	@v2		Value of noun2
	@w1		Weight of noun1
	@w2		Weight of noun2
	@pw		Password
	@gp		Games Played
	@sc		Players Score
	@sg		Points scored this game.
	@lr		Last reset
	@lc		Last compile

Please note, that in the examples ALL options are included, and are entered
in uppercase. AMUL is _NOT_ case sensitive.

Example...:

Notes.....: AMUL only knows the names of players logged in. If the player
	   types "summon fred" and fred isn't on-line, it won't be known as
	   a players name. The above checks for this - !player means anything
	   but a players name.

	    always reply "The key turns in the lock..."
Notes.....: I  must  admit this is not the best example of this function,
	    but  it shows one way that skip can be used to alternate the
	    state of an object.

Parameters: <n>
Purpose...: Prints a '.' every second, for <n> seconds.
Example...: verb=wait
	    - message "Time passes{"
	    bleep 3
Notes.....: The  is mearly a more visual wait command.  Note the { on the
	    end  of  the  message...  this prevents a carriage return after
	    the  message  so  that  the '.' signs appear straight after the
	    message.
