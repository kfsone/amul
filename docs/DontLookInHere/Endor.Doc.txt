 Endor -- END doOR session
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Endor is a simple CLI utility. It will be of greatest use to people
  writing their own doors and to SysOps trying to install doors which do
  not support the Paragon door protocol.

   Endor accepts ONE parameter, a paragon line number (0-9). If the door
  port for that line can be located, Endor tells the port controller to
  end the door session (door command 20, Exit). This releases the line and
  returns control to Paragon/StarNet without logging the user off.

   Programs such as AMUL or World Empire which use a shared serial port
  (or Getty device according to WEmp) can be used with Paragon/StarNet,
  but most SysOps seem to have been doing this using the Executer door by
  Shaun O'Neil.

   Now you can do it quickly and simply (and on multiple-lines) by setting
  up a script similar to RunAMUL.Bat.... All you need do is to call the
  door program as per normal, but at the end of the script make sure to call
  ENDOR <lineno> to release the line.


	Examples:

		The door port on line 0 has seized up, type:

			1> endor 0

		Script to run AMUL from local or line 1


			.key lineno/a
			; above line accepts ONE parameter - line no.

			if <lineno> eq 0	; local line?
				amul
			endif
			if <lineno> eq 1	; line 1?
				amul -s 0 serial.device 0
			endif
			endor <lineno>		; end door session
