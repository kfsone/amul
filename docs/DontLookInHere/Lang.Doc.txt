                              1)  Introduction
                              ----------------


 When KingFisher Software sat down to design their original M.U.A, in 1987, we
decided  the first objective was to put the AMUL user in FULL control over his
system.   User friendliness wasn't quite such a high ranking figure.  Over 250
functions  were  defined  to  execute  every  conceivable action required, and
nearly 200 of them had matching conditional statements, giving the user nearly
450 commands to remember...  Plus all of the other file formats to remember.

 That  first,  archaic  language,  MT-ON  (Master  Terminal ON), was a mass of
brackets,  braces and percentage signs.  Although it would have made the basis
for  a  VERY  powerful in house system, it was doubtful that anyone would ever
really get to grips with it.

 AMUL  consists  of  as  many  .TXT files as it does, in order to give you the
fullest  control;  without  having  to  write  your own multi-user interaction
routines!

 So  far  we  have discussed file formats, and so far that is all that most of
the files have been.

 Now  we  come  to  the crunch.  The centre of an AMUL game.  The Language and
Travel  tables.   Between them they instruct your game how to behave depending
on  what  the  user  types.   The  AMUL  system  provides the shell, the front
end/frame; you have to provide the guts (the kernel as many people call it).

 Don't  worry  if  you  have never used any programming languages before.  You
don't  need  to  have done!  The only bonus a programmer can expect is that he
may be able to type a little faster.

 AMUL  deals in objects, people and relations.  Some would call it a glorified
relational  database.   AMUL's  programming  language  simply  deals,  in near
English  terms, with the sort of thing that the human brain deals with all the
time!   It  should  come  pretty  naturally to anyone.  All you need is a good
imagination and a lot of patience!
