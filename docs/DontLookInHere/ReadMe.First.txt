 AMUL - THE Amiga Multi-User adventure/RPG Language	(Father of AGL)
 --------------------------------------------------

  "KingFisher S/W", "KingFisher Software", "KFS D&EG" or "KFS" are short for
  KingFisher Software Development and Enhancement Group International.

  "The AMUL System" entails all executable programs which compose the AMUL
  System; these being "AMUL", "AMULCom" and "AMAN" and "AWho".

  "AMUL Documentation" entails all documents relating to AMUL or other
  assosciated programs.

  "User files" or "Examples" entails non-executable/non-documentation
  files/programs enclosed within AMUL archives, such as example adventure
  files, example script files, Registration templates and so forth.


  The AMUL System and all executable programs that entails, are ShareWare.
  This means they may be freely distributed. However, anyone possessing any
  copy/copies of AMUL for a total of more than 60 days is bound to either
  register with the authors for continued usage, or to remove all copies of
  The AMUL System from his machine(s) and or other equipment/media.

  Registration of The AMUL System covers ONLY one person, and such machines
  as are actually possesed by themselves. This covers a MAXIMUM of THREE
  Computing devices ("Computers").

  Failure to comply with this "Pay as you use" scheme is THEFT. If, after
  60 days you retain a copy of AMUL (other than in its archived state) and/
  or use such a version, said copy is ILLEGAL/Pirate!

  The ShareWare registration fee for The AMUL System is 15 GB Pounds. If you
  feel, however, that The AMUL System is worth more than 15 pounds, every
  extra pound will go in your favour 8-). We cannot accept payments in foreign
  currencies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


  ALL AMUL Documentation and User Files/Examples are PUBLIC DOMAIN.


==============================================================================

DESPERATE PLEA!
---------------

Due to difficult financial circumstances, the author of AMUL is currently
computerless. This is not a problem. I have access to a computer but only
on floppies; therefore AMUL development is slow and irratic. There are no
plans for him to return to the computer world except to finish AMUL. *IF*
you want to see this project finished,  your money is DESPERATELY needed!
All money will go towards buying an A500 SCSI controller to enable me the
use of the Quantum Hard-Drive which contains my 'C'-Compiler, AMUL Source
and various other bits and pieces.

If you happen to be or atleast be in-touch with a member of *any* company
(either Soft- or Hard-ware based) which could help us and would be in ANY
way interested in supporting this project, then **PLEASE** atleast get in
touch with me... You may be able to help!

==============================================================================

About the documentation
-----------------------

 Please read through the various .DOC files BEFORE turning to AMULDoc.Txt and
FuncDoc.Txt.... The latter are OLDER versions of the documents, and should be
used to fill any gaps left through the various (incomplete) .DOC files.

 The full set of .DOC files will be finished by version 0.9 or 1.0 of AMUL.

 Also, you should  read Apollogy.AMUL and any Updates.AMULxxx files which
come within the archive.
