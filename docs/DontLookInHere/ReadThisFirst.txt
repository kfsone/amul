  AMUL v0.8.99-8
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


 This release deals with a few VERY serious bugs and irons out a few wrinkles
in the last versions. Please note that I no-longer have the development
system and only have access to an Amiga A500 with NO HARD DRIVES. If you want
to see further developments of AMUL you'll have to make it worth my while
by registering. THE NEW REGISTRATION FEE IS TWELVE POUNDS (12 GBP).

 I have revised some of the documentation but not all of it. Included is a
fairly basic sample adventure called 'Precious'. PLEASE - do NOT modify the
contents of this archive before redistributing.

 Anyone interested in taking a COMMERCIAL bite into AMUL (say as a fully
developed, fully saleable project) should contact me IMMEDIATELY!
