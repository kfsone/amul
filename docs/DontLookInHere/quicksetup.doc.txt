                AMUL - The Amiga Multi-User games Language
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                             Quick Setup Guide
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Well, you've obviously followed SOME of the basics to installing
	AMUL quickly, simply by unarchiving this file. However, for the
	sake of a simple life you should follow these simple guide lines.

	The following quick-installation guide assumes you are installing
	AMUL on a Hard Drive based system... If not, don't worry, follow
	the same procedure, but have a flask of coffee ready.

	Step 1: Create a directory called 'ADV' or 'AMUL' somewhere on your
		system, eg: "dh0:adv" or "dh1:amul".

	Step 2: Re-extract the AMUL archive into that directory. Once that
		has finished, unarchive any 'sub-archives' eg std.lzh.
		Note that the sub-archives will automatically create sub-
		directories.

	Step 3: In your startup-sequence add the following lines, or merge
		them with existing lines:

			assign adv: dh0:adv
			path adv: add

		*ONLY* change the 'dh0:adv' if your AMUL system lies in a
		different path; PLEASE keep the 'adv:' assign if possible.
		Now either reboot your system or enter these lines manually.

	Step 4: You now need to compile the example adventure provided in
		the archives. The sample adventure will either be in the
		'Precious' or 'std' or 'game' archive. You need to run a
		program called AMULCOM to compile the game. The parameters
		to AMULCOM are simply: amulcom <directory>, so you might
		type:

			amulcom precious
		or	amulcom std
		or	amulcom game

		depending on the name of the directory.

		The sample adventure should now compile. Once it is finished
		type:

			run aman adv:<path>
		eg:	run aman adv:game
		or	run aman adv:precious

		[NOTE: If you want AMAN to load automatically each time your
		 system starts, add the above line to your startup-sequence]

	Step 5:	Once the AMUL Manager is loaded (AMAN) you can type:

			run amul

	To remove AMAN type:

		aman -k

	To 'reset' a game (and throw all current users off) type:

		aman -r
	or	aman -r X	to reset in X seconds time.

	To 'extend' a game by X number of seconds type:

		aman -x X	where X is the number of seconds to add

	* NOTE *

		To install AMUL as a StarNet door, you will need some ARexx
	or DOS script files; contact Jon Witty on MetNet Triangle UK BBS if
	you want these files...

	** second note **

		Please forgive the scruffines of this doc, but my keyboard
	has no 's' key, I have to poke a match into the hole where it used
	to be, or install it as a macro within CED (Amiga-D at the mo)!

	** final note **

		AMUL and Precious Days ARE STILL being developed.
