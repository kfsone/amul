                     ESC.Doc - Details of Escape Sequences
                     -------------------------------------

 Escape codes are constructed with a three character code. The first character
is always an AT ('@') and then two characters. The second, in some cases, is a
numeric digit, between 0-9. In the list below, this is indicated by a capital
N.

Code	Replaced With			Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@me	my name				Hello @me, how are you?
@m!	my name (padded to 21 chars)	Name: @m! Rank: @mr (eg in Score cmd)
@mr	my rank's name			You are currently ranked @mr.
@gn	my gender (male or female)	@gns aren't allowed in there!
@ge	he or she depending on sex	@ge is @gn! (eg He is male!)
@go	his or her depending on sex	@gn dropped @gh gun.
@gh	him or her depending on sex	You hit @gh square on the nose!
@vb	Verb entered by player		You can't @vb that!
@ve	Last verb 'treatas'ed		@me @ves you "@n1". (@ve might be tell)
@n1	noun1 REGARDLESS OF TYPE!	You say "@n1".

@v2	Value of noun2			The @n2 is worth @v2 points!
@w1	Weight of noun1			The @n1 weighs @w1g
@w2	Weight of noun2			The @n2 weighs @w1g

@xx	YOUR name or 'SOMEONE'		@xx taps you on the shoulder.
@xy	Name & rank or 'SOMEONE'	@xy growls.

* NOTE *

There are two SPECIAL escape codes: @xx and @xy. These are designed for
making player interaction simpler. The result varies for each receiving
user. As a default @xx displays your name, while @xy displays your name
and rank (eg @xx gives 'Fred' and @xy gives 'Fred the Low-Ranked'). But
if the player being sent the message cannot see you, then the output of
both changes. The output ALSO varies depending on whether you're in the
same room as the other player or not!

An example usage might be when a player knocks on a door:

	verb=knock
	syntax=verb noun=door
		checknear noun		; Are we near one?
		-> objaction noun "@xx knocks on the door."

To all players who can see you, it might look like
	> Fred knocks on the door.
Anyone nearby who can't see you (eg dark room, they're blind or whatever)
	> Someone nearby knocks on the door.
While players in another room might see
	> Someone knocks on the door.

Below are the various outputs from @xx and @xy...

 @xx is used for 'players name', @xy is for 'players name [and rank]'

	same room	same room	diff room	diff room
	visible to	! visible	< top-rank	top-rank
	---------------------------------------------------------
@xx:
act.:	player's name	Someone nearby	Someone		Someone very powerful
ann.:	player's name	Someone nearby	Someone		Someone
@xy:
act.:	@me the @mr	Someone nearby
					A powerful @gn voice in the distance
							A @gn voice in the distance
ann.:	@me the @mr	A @gn voice nearby
					A powerful @gn voice in the distance
							A @gn voice in the distance

Using  these codes you can produce very good interactive code with a minimum
of effort.
