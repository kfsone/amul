Changes from AMUL 0.906 -> SMUGL

1. Ported from Amiga to Unix (and no minor feat too!)
 . Also converted all source code to C++
 . Implemented revision control
 . Started switching on compiler warnings during development, so the
  code is much, much cleaner.

2. Improved text processing routines slightly

3. Various Amiga-specific features removed or made redundant
 . Screen variables/font options in SYSTEM.txt redudant

4. Improved memory management and usage in AMULCOM
 .  Room Processor builds room table "in memory" rather than by writing
  to disc, and then re-loading.

5. ROOMS.txt improvements:
 . DMOVE processing: Evaluated on the fly, or if no match is found,
  a small second-pass table is built and evaluated after ROOMS.txt

6. SMSG/UMSG and text-message improvements:
 . Indexes are built dynamically, and in memory. Old system used to
  keep indexes on disk during compile and kept UMSG id's on disk in
  a temporary file. The file I/O added significant overhead.

7. Object ID length increased from 12 to 14

8. Object descriptions (and their IDs) are now stored along with system
  and Umsgs; they still have their own .txt file, though.

9. Implemented a "Vocab Table". Instead of having to store the word
  "door" for each door, it simply stores the vocab identified for
  'door'. The vocab table has a hashed-index, so looking up a word
  from the vocab table is *very* fast (250 hash keys should be
  sufficient for most games!)

10. Massive reduction in disk I/O done by SMUGLcom. Where possible
  I've moved stuff to memory. It allows itself the odd bit of memory.

11. RANKS.TXT:
  There is no-longer a ranks.txt file, the ranks have been moved
  into the '[ranks]' section of system.txt
