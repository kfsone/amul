============================================

1. Compiling SMUGL

This is now handled by a GNU autoconf script; simply go to the
top-level smugl directory and type:
$ ./configure
or, if you want full optimization:
$ CFLAGS="-g -O6" ./configure
or, if you are making changes to the code:
$ ./develconfigure

If the configure script is successful, simply type:

$ make depend
$ make

============================================

2. Running SMUGL

Before you can run SMUGL, you will need 'SMUGLCom' and, of course, a
game ;-). See ../smuglcom/README for details on building SMUGLCom.
See the main documentation if you want to write your own game.

Assuming that your game is in '../test':

 $ smuglcom ../test
 $ smugl ../test

The game will be listening on whatever port you defined in system.text,
which defaults to port 9000:

 $ telnet localhost 9000

============================================

3. SMUGL specific compile time options

*ALL* of the configuration option values are in smugl.h; I will eventually
(when there are enough of them) move them into config.h or something.
For now, they can stay there ;-).

Please only edit values in the range specified.

COMMAND_ADDR: INADDR_LOOPBACK
Determines what address the command port should be bound to. If your
machine doesn't support the LOOPBACK interface (127.0.0.1) then you
will need to change this to INADDR_ANY
Note: the value INADDR_LOOPBACK means that only users on your machine
can connect to the command port. Whereas INADDR_ANY allows anyone to
connect to it.
The Command Port provides an administrative interface for SMUGL
tools to allow outside-game control of the SMUGL universe.

DLLEN:        80
Defines the default, assumed, screen width or line length (i.e. 80 chars)

DSLEN:        24
Defines the default, assumed, screen length, i.e. 24 lines

DFLAGS:       ufCRLF
Specifies that default, assumed, terminal settings. Should be a
combination of 'uf' values (User Flag). The default, ufCRLF, tells
SMUGL to always send '\r\n' as a line ending.

4.2 Conventions

4.2.1 Class Methods

 . All classes must have a 'int describe()' function, which describes
  the object from a viewers perspective.
 . All describe functions must return:
    TRUE if something was tx()d
    FALSE if nothing was tx()d
