. 0.3.24+
 . Fixed bug in command line parsing (didn't understand -f / -d without
   an explicit directory name)
 . Fixed room->describe() when short line of description

. 0.3.23 - 0.3.24
 * Added configure script using GNU Autoconf, this resulted in significant
   number of changes to Makefiles and their layout, etc.
 . revisited most of the code for 'purity' purposes; smugl now
   compiles completely cleanly; also some restructuring
 . embeded CVS ID strings into binaries so 'ident' works
 . numerous 'glitch' and 'bug' fixes; e.g., bug in the storage
   of certain counters which were declared 'short' but being
   handled as longs :-(. Worked on i386 bit exposed on m68k arch
 . compiles (and works) under:
  . Linux i386
  . OpenBSD m68k
 . @po (other players online) is now prefixed with 'is' or 'are'
 . generally tidied up error reporting and logging, now uses syslog
 . added '-d' and '-f' options to SMUGL:
   -d  lets you specify additional debugging output to syslog (logged
       as local0.notice and local0.info)
   -f  tells smugl to detach from your terminal after loading the database
