This is "SMUGL" - the Simple Multi-User Game Language.

If you were planning to kill WoW, you've come to the wrong place; SMUGL
is for writing text-based, adventures-style MUDs and talkers.

SMUGL is based on a project from another live, "AMUL", an Amiga based
language. It started out as an experiment to convert AMUL to C++, and
now after many more years of experience with C++, I'm reviving it as a
project to port it to real C++ using STL and etc.  Heck, I may even go
all out and port it to C#.

But I'm also planning to explore various technologies with it; while
having my own language parser is cool, it's not tell-anyone-else cool.
So maybe I'll finally break down and learn to use Antlr or Yacc.

I'm also going to remove my home-grown container classes and instead
use something like STL or Boost.

Because memory was tight on the amiga, AMUL was split into three discrete
processes: Compiler, Client and Manager (which used literal memory
sharing *cringe*). Having the compiler in the manager was prohibitive
in terms of the amount of memory required.

SMUGL 1 has a compiler, a verifier, and a server which you telnet into
to play.

For SMUGL 2 I am contemplating an all-in-one, allowing for more dynamic
games, with some sort of backend storage system that will allow me to
toy with various storage technologies that I've had no more inviting
reason to look at.

However: I'm not wholly sold on that yet, because ultimately smugl is
about the text-file language that generates the game, and having mixed
persistent and non-persistent content might be a tad annoying.
