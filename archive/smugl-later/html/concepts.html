This document describes general concepts and features of SMUGL, which
may be used in a number of other documents, but don't really fall to any
one document to describe.<P>

<OL>
<A NAME="toprank">
<LI> <H4> '<I>Wizards</I>' - top rank players </H4>
It is generally assumed, although it is not mandatory in your game,
that players who achieve the games top rank will be bestowed with
powers that may seem 'magical' to lower-ranking players of the game.<P>

The term 'wizard' is used throughout SMUGL documentation to indicate
a player of the top rank.<P>

Many older MUDs indoctrinated Wizards to behave somewhat secretively,
yet blessed them with powers to see what other 'mortals' couldn't. For
example, Wizards had access to <A HREF="#supergo">teleport</A>
commands, and so could pop in and out of any location in the game.<P>
</LI>

<A NAME="supergo">
<LI> <H4> '<I>supergo</I>'ing - hopping between rooms </H4>
Players with a rank equal or greater than the <A HREF="system.html#minsgo"><I>minsgo=</I></A>
variable have the ability to move between any two locations, simply by
entering the Room ID of the new location. System message 42 is sent
to the player doing the supergo, message 43 is sent to players who can
see their departure, and message 44 is sent to players who can see their
arrival.<P>

While developing your game, it is recommended that you set
<PRE>
  minsgo=0
</PRE>
to allow any player of any rank to use the facility. As your game grows
to maturity, you should gradually crank this value up to your top rank,
or omit it entirely if you want to disable the facility.<P>
</LI>

<HR>
<A NAME="baubles">
<LI> <H4> Sanctuaries and Baubles - treasures for new players </H4>
SMUGL maintains the concept of a 'Sanctuary' room, where players can
discard objects in exchange for points. The most classic example of
such a location was the Swamp in the original Essex MUD.<P>

Simple, low-value objects give low ranking players a simple way of
running up some score, in exchange for learning their way around your
world. They also provide a way for experienced players to quickly
clock up points if they have some how lost points or rank.<P>

There are two disadvantages with this concept as defined above:<P>

<OL>
<LI> Once dropped in the sanctuary, the objects are out of play until
the next reset. This means that the trinkets tend to dissapear early
in the game; thus it is rarely worth making them of any use, and it
also leaves the game feeling 'bare' later into the game. </LI>
<LI> Experienced, higher-rank players tend to enter the game shortly
after resets, rapidly collect a horde of baubles, and gain large
amount of points.<P>
</OL>

These negative effects can be reduced with <A HREF="#scaling">Scaling</A>.<P>
</LI>

<HR>
<A NAME="scaling">
<LI> <H4> RankScale and TimeScale - object value scaling </H4>
Scaling adjusts the value of objects according to rank and time to
next reset. This allows you to create objects which are only valuable
to low ranking players and, but which become more interesting (scorewise)
as the game progresses.<P>

<A HREF="system.html#rankscale">rankscale</A>
reduces the value of objects as the players rank increases, 
<A HREF="system.html#timescale">timescale</A>
increases the value of objects as the game progress towards the reset. Both
values are specified in <A HREF="system.html#rankscale">system.txt</A>.<P>

Both rankscale and timescale are gradient values; that is, if you have
10 ranks and you specify <TT>rankscale=100</TT> then 'scaled' object values
will be affected as follows:<P>

<CENTER>
<H4> RankScaling Effect Example </H4>
<TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white FGCOLOR=black>
 <TR> <TH> Rank </TH> <TH> Adjustment </TH> <TH> 200 points becomes </TH> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 1 </TD>    <TD> 0 </TD>          <TD> 200 </TD> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 3 </TD>    <TD> -30% </TD>       <TD> 140 </TD> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 5 </TD>    <TD> -50% </TD>       <TD> 100 </TD> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 10 </TD>   <TD> -100% </TD>      <TD> 0 </TD> </TR>
</TABLE><P>
</CENTER>

If you declare <TT>timescale=200</TT>, and <TT>session=150</TT>, then
value adjustments would be as follows:

<CENTER>
<H4> TimeScaling Effect Example </H4>
<TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white FGCOLOR=black>
 <TR> <TH> Game Time </TH> <TH> Adjustment </TH> <TH> 200 points becomes </TH> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 0 mins </TD>    <TD> -200% </TD>      <TD> -200 </TD> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 30 mins </TD>   <TD> -160% </TD>      <TD> -120 </TD> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 75 mins </TD>   <TD> -100% </TD>      <TD> 0    </TD> </TR>
 <TR> <TD> 150 mins </TD>  <TD> -0% </TD>        <TD> 200  </TD> </TR>
