<A NAME="rooms">
<H3> 1. <TT>rooms.txt</TT> Description </H3>

<H4> 1.1 Brief </H4>

<TT>rooms.txt</TT> defines the rooms that will exist, their properties,
and their descriptions. The relationships between rooms (exits) are
defined seperately in <A HREF="#travel"><TT>travel.txt</TT></A>.<P>

The rooms file is one of the simplest, consisting mostly of
<A HREF="index.html#freetext">free format text</A>.<P>

Despite the simplicity of this file, within the game itself, rooms
are treated as objects with reduced functionality.<P>

<H4> 1.2 Content and Format </H4>

Each element in the file defines a room which must have a unique identifier
or Room ID. Room Identifiers The template for a room element is as follows:<P>

<PRE>
  [room=]id [&lt;flags&gt;]
  Short Description (One line)
  Long Description (Many Lines)
</PRE>

Both 'Short Description' and 'Long Description' are optional; you must
specify a Short Description of you want to include a Long Description.<P>

Explanation:

<UL>
<LI> <TT>[room=]id</TT>: defines the room's identifier; the phrase
     '<TT>room=</TT>' is optional. </LI>
<LI> <TT>&lt;flags&gt;</TT>: A combination of the flags/parameters
     listed below, specifying the type and behaviour of the room.</LI>
<LI> <TT>Short Description</TT>: Is a single line (but no limit on the
     length of the line) which is always displayed when the room is
     described. Optional unless you want to specify a Long Description.
     Typically something briefly identifying the room such as "Cave" or
     "Central Hall". </LI>
<LI> <TT>Long Description</TT>: This is a full description of the location.
     This will not be displayed if the player is in "brief" mode or if
     the player is in "room count" mode and has already visited this room. <BR>
     <B> NOTE: </B> For clarities sake, you can indent each line of the
     room description with a single tab; these will be stripped from the
     text when it is compiled into the game data. </LI>

There is no limit to the number of rooms you can define.<P>

Currently defined flags are:<P>

<UL>
DEATH

SHINES

<H4> 1.3 Example Rooms </H4>

An example excerpt from a rooms.txt file:

<PRE>
  ;; Sample rooms.txt

  ; This is a 'startloc', so the game will begin here
  room=begining startloc
  A Beginning.
  This is the begining of the game.
  The description can be as long as I like.

  ; We won't bother giving the dark hall a clever description
  ; because you probably can't see it
  room=darkhall dark
  Dark Hall.

  ; End of file
