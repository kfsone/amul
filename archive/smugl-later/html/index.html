<H4> 1.1 About SMUGL </H4>
<I><B>SMUGL</B></I> is the <TT><B>S</B>imple <B>M</B>ulti-<B>U</B>ser <B>G</B>ames <B>L</B>anguage</TT>, based on <I><B>AMUL</B></I>, the <TT><B>A</B>miga <B>M</B>ulti-<B>U</B>ser Games <B>L</B>angunage</TT>. Both languages were
developed by <A HREF="mailto:oliver@kfs.org">Oliver Smith</A> of
<A HREF="http://www.kfs.org/">KingFisher Software</A>.<P>

SMUGL is intended for writing MUDs of the old (e.g. essex mud) style,
or writing talkers or similar. The language itself is designed to be
flexible, powerful but (hopefully) simple. The components are broken
down into seperate files intended to make game development easy. There
is a certain logic about the whole thing, though, that means with a
little instruction, everything suddenly becomes very logical.<P>

AMUL was designed in early 1990, and resurrected as SMUGL due to the
popularity of the language with those who tried it. It is a VERY
easy language to laern; all of the files use simple templated formats,
and the key part of the language has a small, easy to learn set of
constructs.<P>

<H4> 1.2 Game Environment </H4>

A SMUGL game consists of upto 32 players interacting in a shared
world. Almost every aspect of that world is configurable (and any
that aren't will be eventually). The world exists for a finite
period of time, a session, after which all of the non-player
objects (i.e. rooms and objects) are 'reset' (returned to their
initial states and configurations). All logged-in players are
ejected at the beginning of the reset.<P>

At the very core of the universe is the <TT>Basic Object</TT>, which
is the common denominator of all other types of entity. A basic object
describes one or more presences of one of the three type of game entity:
Rooms, Objects and Players. A room is a bare-bones object, however, it is
a container in every aspect that an object is a container - it is therefore
possible to place one or more rooms inside another, or even inside an
object. You can also treat an object as a location.<P>

Beyond this, the game consists of other elements such as Ranks, the
Travel Table, Mobiles and Daemons. Ranks determine properties of players
as they progress through the game; the Travel Table describes the links
between different locations; Mobiles allow you to animate objects with
their own personalities; Daemons allow you to create timers and background
events.<P>

<A NAME="lang">
<H3> 2. Language </H3> <P>

<H4> 2.1 General Formatting </H4>
This section describes some of the common and key aspects of the
SMUGL language. For details of the operating environment, see section
<A HREF="#1.2">1.2</A><P>

All SMUGL files are ASCII text. Semicolon (';') is used to indicate
comments. Both space and tab are considered as field delimiters,
and carriage return is considered a line delimter. Two or more
consecutive end-of-lines are considered 'End of Paragraph' (EOP).<P>

Outside of text strings, you can use comma (<TT>,</TT>) to place
multiple lines on a single physical line, e.g.
<PRE>
  line1, line2, line3
</PRE>
is considered as 3 seperate lines.<P>

A single line may be extended across multiple physical lines by
suffixing the line with '+' or '\', e.g.
<PRE>
  this \
  is   +
  one \
  line
</PRE>
<P>

<H4> 2.2 Paragraphs/Elements </H4>
Most SMUGL files are divided up into paragraphs; each paragraph
represents a single SMUGL element, be it a room, message or
object.<P>

Every element has an identifier; for some files these must be
unique, while others can be used many times.<P>

All SMUGL elements start with a label-line:<BR>
<PRE>
  [&lt;type&gt;=}&lt;label&gt; [&lt;flags&gt;]
</PRE><P>

<UL>
<LI> There must be no leading white-space at the beginning
     of a label line. </LI>
<LI> <TT>type</TT> is optional, but specific to each file
     and each element type. Whilst it is mostly redundant,
     this mechanism is provided to make locating a given
     entry in a file easier. It is <I>strongly</I> recommended
     that you always include this tag. </LI>
<LI> <TT>label</TT> is the name, or identified, for this
     element. For example, an object name, or a system message
     i.d. </LI>
<LI> <TT>flags</TT> are specific to each type of element,
     see <A HREF="#files">file-specific documentation</A> for more details. </LI>
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="freetext">
<H4>2.3 Free-format text</H4>
Some SMUGL files, such as the <A HREF="#rooms.txt">room descriptions file</A>,
consist mainly of free-format text. If you need to insert a blank line into
a paragraph of descriptive text, do so by inserting a line containing at least
one space or tab. Placing a line containing only a carriage return in a
paragraph of free-format text will cause the compiler to complain about the
contents.<P>

<H4>3.1 Organisation of Files</H4>
Although all of the language files are based on common principles, each
file has it's own, tailored object format. The descriptions of each are
included in seperate files below; some of the files are similar or
related enough that they are grouped together in the table:<P>

<H3> 4. Running </H3> <P>

<H4> 4.1 Running <TT>smuglcom</TT> </H4>

You will need to run 'smuglcom' everytime you create or update
a SMUGL game. On fast machines, compilation should usually be a matter
of seconds; on slower machines it may take as long as a couple of
mintes. However, you do not need to recompile the game everytime
you wish to run SMUGL.<P>

Command line options are simple:<P>

<PRE>
  smuglcom [options] [directory]
</PRE>
where options are:
<PRE>
  -?  Display command-line help
  -v  Display version of smuglcom
  -q  Quiet (don't display warnings)
  -s  Print 'hash stats' after compiling
</PRE><P>

If no <TT>directory</TT> is specified, smuglcom will default
to compiling a game in the current directory.<P>

The resulting compiled game is written to a directory
called 'Data' in the game directory.<P>

<H4> 4.2 Running <TT>smugl</TT> </H4>

Once invoked, SMUGL fork(2)s a copy of itself every time a
new connection arrives, to act as a client. A copy of SMUGL
must, therefore, be running whenever you want your game to be
available for logins.<P>

Command line options are:<P>

<PRE>
  smugl [options] [directory]
</PRE>
where options are:
<PRE>
  -?  Display command-line help
  -f  Fork(2) (detatch from user) after loading
  -d  Increment 'debug' level
</PRE><P>

If no <TT>directory</TT> is specified, smugl tries to load
a game from the 'Data' sub-directory in the current directory.<P>

The <TT>-f</TT> flag can be used to run smugl as a daemon.<P>
