Before SMUGL there was AMUL, Amiga Multi-User game Language(*). SMUGL
is essentially an experimental redo of AMUL.

amul.tbz2 is one of the last remaining copies of the AMUL source code
I was able to find when I started working on SMUGL, which is itself
a transitional version of a prior AMUL release.

AMUL development started out on floppy drives, and as it grew, I
started having to compact the code, and then I started having to
literally edit files and compact stuff with macros and whatnot.

I'm fairly sure this code is from the period where I started to
refactor for my 10Mb(!) hard drive, and I'm not sure how close it
is to an actual working state =/.

However - the includes and etc still provide a lot of the original
code for what little reference value they still provide.


(* This was before Harry Potter, and  thought "AMUGL" sounded like
something that might jump you in a dark alley).
