The last public release of AMUL was version 0.9.00 (0900), but over the years
I appear to have loste my copy of the disk with those sources.

AMUL 900 was actually what lead me to start my time working in the ISP sector,
but it was also the last version of "AMUL" that I actually built.

After version 900 I was looking at 1.0 and wanted to change the name.

The first name I chose was "AGL" - Amiga Game Language. I'd been doing a lot of
work on making it possible to run games like AMUL from inside some popular
BBS software, and also written "AMod" (Answer that Modem) as a way to eliminate
needing a BBS just to run games.

I didn't like the name and would have gone back to AMUL if it weren't for the
fact that people always seemed to balk at my use of the "L" for language or
just Amiga MULti...

So I changed to AMUD.

"AGL" is incomplete and represents AMUL v0.9.06. Unknown functionality.
"AMUD" is also incomplete and represents AMUL 0.9.10.
"SMUGL" is a later project:

Later in the 90s, I wanted to refactor AMUL as a Linux-based project to
explore Linux-based development using "C with classes" (C++). I wanted to
call this "Simple Multi-User Game Language".

Unfortunately, lot of work to get a former ANSI-C Amiga game running under
Linux, never mind converting to a new paradigm (object oriented) in a language
I didn't really understand.

There is a version of SMUGL that was able to compile and launch a MUD, and
you could more-or-less wander around and execute various commands, but I got
kind of busy around that time and I never finished it.

I think I also learned what I needed to about C++, and I really didn't want
to clean up the mess I'd made of learning it thru SMUGL.

SMUGL is included here largely because it is based on the last working
versions of AMUL source that I no-longer have access to.

"smugl-src" is one of the earlier snapshots of smugl, while "smugl-later"
is from some unknown later period when I'd discovered CMake. It is at an
unknown level of functionality.
