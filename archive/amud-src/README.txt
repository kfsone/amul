This is a snapshot of one of my last original-AMUL refactors, where I was in the
process of renaming it to "AMUD".

This is one of the closest versions I have to the final AMUL (900) source, but it
is also in an unknown state of operability.

AGH.LHA
	-- snapshot of a floppy where I was reorganizing header files for
	   the previous incarnation, "AGH"
AMULSRC8992.LHA
	-- the source as of AMUL 8.9.92	(prior to the last good release)
		missing a lot of functionality
compacth.lha
	-- compressed system header files from the Amiga
lattice.lha
	-- lattice C files from my compiler floppy
