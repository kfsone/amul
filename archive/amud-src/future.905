                   ### Future plans as of version 0.9.05 ###


1/
  Continue  conversion  to  68000 assembler, and transfer as much code to the
  library as possible.  This will reduce code size.

2/
  Intelligent  I/O  system!   At  present  AMUL's  I/O is built into the AMUL
  program,  consuming  memory  each  time  the  program is run (including the
  mobile/daemon  line).  By placing this code in the library, it need only be
  loaded into memory once.  Each time an AMUL line is launched, it will go to
  the  library for it's IO drivers, which will create a resident task, vastly
  reducing the memory requirements.

3/
  ARexx  bolton.   This  will  be  a  small,  external program, which sits in
  memory,  creating  "clone  tasks"  every time an ARexx port is needed.  The
  main  task  will  allow  comms  between  external  scripts and AMan, whilst
  enabling AMUL lines to create a temporary port for running in-game scripts.
  It will be written in assembler for speed and size.

4/
  Multi-Game  ability.   This will allow several games to run concurrently on
  one  system.  It will require the main portions of AMan to be made resident
  (through  the  library).   There  will also be an overall "game controller"
  which  will  run  at  a  level ABOVE existing AMan's.  This will require an
  Inter-World Lobby, which will simply be a menu for selecting which game you
  want (Note:  there will be an option to bypass this is you are only running
  a single game).  Players will be able to "sit" in the lobby during reset of
  games,  or whilst waiting for a game to be loaded.  The menu will give full
  details of status of games.

  NOTE:   While  players  are sat in the lobby, they are informed when a game
  has  finished  or  started  resetting - thus when players are kicked out at
  reset,  they  simply  have  to  wait in the lobby till they are told "Reset
  Completed."

5/
  Inter-World   Conference.    A   simple   'chat   mode'  facility  allowing
  communications between players outside of the games.  Messages about resets
  are sent here too.

  Because most of the code used for the conference would be already contained
  in amul.library, the conference would also be built in.

6/
  Full  user accounting system (bolton).  This would allow people not running
  BBS's  to  set-up  a  complete  MUG.   BTW:  It is now possible to BUY X.25
  modems;  if  you  can  find a driver for the Amiga, you could easily set-up
  your  own  mutli-line  PAD, allowing you to have a REAL MUG running!  There
  should be ways to even connect you up to InterNet, giving you access to the
  hordes  of  MUGgers  out  there.   If anyone finds a way to do that; I'd be
  really  interested!   It  would  be  interestting to see what the LPMudders
  think to an AMUL game!

There are a whole host more things I intend to do; so briefly:

  Single turn combat (e.g.  hit, punch, kick).  Player<->mobile combat.  Drag
  'Helpers' into fights.  Far more 'verbose' fight sequences.  Simplification
  of  commands;  e.g  sameroom <player> and ishere <noun> to be replaced with
  ONE  command which accepts PLAYER or NOUN.  Generation of a VOCAB table and
  more  structure  data-storage/representation.  Option 'MUDESCRIBE'; instead
  of  putting  a Carriage Return after listing players/objects, everything is
  thrown into one huge "mess", which means that object descriptions look more
  like  part  of the room description.  Believe me, it makes players behave a
  little better, and it looks a lot less like a spectrum adventure.
