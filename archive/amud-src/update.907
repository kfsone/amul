1]
   Renamed the following actions:
      reply	   -> print
      endparse	   -> end
      failparse	   -> fail
      finishparse  -> finish
      abortparse   -> abort
      sleep	   -> inflict me sleep
      wake	   -> cure me sleep

   I  have  removed the support for "prepositions" (or preps) in AMUL.  This
   reduces  the  amount  of  data needed for each verb.  Whilst doing this I
   also  discovered a minor typo which was causing AMUL to get confused when
   someone  was interupted in mid-processing by a daemon.  Nasty little bug,
   but it's alright now (sigh).

3]
   When  AMUL  lists  EXITS to a user; if it finds a direction with an ERROR
   message, it will display the error.  So, you could have:

      north: Small room.
      east: The door is closed!

   This gives users a much better idea of the working of the land.

4]
   AMULCom  is  now  fixed  to  remove  all  carriage returns from long room
   descriptions.  This FORCES text formatting to be handled by AMUL's output
   functions  based  on the users individual terminal settings.  If you want
   to add a return, you'll have to "hard code" it with a "^M" or "@cr" code.

5]
   I  have  re-worked  the LOOK function.  Instead of seperating the objects
   and  players  from  the room description, AMUL will now print them all as
   one  long chunk of text.  I realise some of you won't like this at first,
   but it forces players to read the room descriptions more often.

6]                          ** SYSOPS READ THIS **

   The  bug  noted  by  STarNet SysOps, where the first character typed by a
   serial  user  is  NOT  the fault of AMUL!  After every keypress received,
   STarNet  sends  another  "IO  Request" to give you the "typeahead" sense.
   Unfortunately,  when it executes an ARexx Script/Door, it doesn't "flush"
   that request, so the first key to get hit gets sent to STarNet.  However,
   according  to  the ROM Kernel manual I have, the device command CMD_FLUSH
   should  do this for me.  So I've put one in.  That means that if the user
   STILL  looses their first character, you gotta persuade your STarNet guys
   to  either  provide  decent  interactive  IO  facilities (like Jon did in
   Paragon 2.0) or they gotta have a special "Function MultiRunDoor [BYPASS]
   [OWNDRIVER] <Door>" method of running doors.

7]
   This one will definitely annoy several people.  For the sake of speed and
   size  I have removed all the text formatting code from AMUL.  It will now
   just  "raw" print the text with allowance for screen length.  This should
   make  the system much less processor intensive, much more responsive, and
   only a little less legible.

   BUT!   Do  not fear!  This is only a temporary measure!  The code will be
   re-implemented   when   I  translate  the  IO  drivers  to  Assembler  in
   AMUL.Library as you'll get the extra speed bonus then anyway.

8]
   Possibly  traced  the recent, random crash in earlier versions.  THINK it
   was located in the Random(N) function in amul.library.  Great stuff!  The
   actual  bug would have lain in the fact that Random returned a number not
   in  the  range of 0 to N, but instead 0 to (N+1).  The mobile code, which
   used the Random function, would have been "mislead" by this, and so would
   occasionally, not predictably, crash.  OK?

9]
   False alarm!  I just put the above code back into the program, but it now
   works   on  a  different  principle.   Previously  it  worked  by  adding
   characters  and  working backwards to the first space/tab when it reached
   the  end of the line.  Now it works by looking AHEAD from every space/tab
   to  see how long the next word is.  This may cause some "uglies".  Let me
   know if you have any problems with text formatting.

10]
   Eek! WHIPPED some highly redundant code out of AMan's daemon processor!

11]
   Lang.Txt:
   You  are  no-longer REQUIRED to give a syntax block.  "SYNTAX=ANY" is the
   default,  and  is  assumed  until  a syntax= line IS specified within the
   verb.  So the following verb is no valid.
	verb=Example,print "Look! No syntax= line!"

12]
   Because  I'm  working  on  TWO floppy drives (both of which are packed to
   their  maximum  capacity), I often make a whole stack of sweeping changes
   and  hope  that I've remembered to make them effective throughout ALL the
   files.   Since compiling takes so-long, I try to get as much done at once
   as   possible.   Unfortunately,  this  usually  means  that  I've  missed
   something  somewhere.   I've  made  a  lot of wide-spread changes to this
   version  of AMUL, so you may find that I have (inadvertantly) implemented
   some new and baffling bugs.  As an example; it is now 6.13 AM on a Sunday
   morning.   I've  spent the best part of tonight and yesterday debugging a
   ridiculous  bug  which I assumed to be in AMUL, whereby only TRAVEL verbs
   would work.  I can tell that you're impressed.

   The  problem  was  simply to do with the feature above (no.  11), in that
   AMULCom  wasn't  including it's "assumed" SYNTAX= line in it's, internal,
   count.   Therefore  all the verbs were wrongly "synched".  Since this bug
   wasn't  in  AMUL, and since it took half an hour to recompile the program
   with  the  debug-code in each time, I didn't figure that one out till 5am
   this morning.  Well, that's kept me busy (and warm, it's awful cold here)
   while it compiled (again).  There, finished my moan now.

13]
On a whim I made a fleet of changes to AMUL which rendered it totally
inoperable. Sigh. I have, therefore, taken the code to work, and have
started working on the code during my lunch hours, with the intention
of re-writing the bulk of AMUL over a period of several months. We'll
see how far I get with this in the next file. I think I may launch it
as AMUD 0.9.1, and bug fix that up to version 1.0.

-- Termination of "AMUL" Project  --

14]
After a conversation with Wim Rumbing, I decided I would rework as much
of AMUL as possible. In order to make this clear, I have also renamed
the project - AMUD : The Amiga Multi-User Dungeon system. This starts
as version 0.9.10, therefore this is the end of update.907
