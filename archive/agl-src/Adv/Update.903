Updates version 0.9.03:

*	Fixed a problem whereby text files/messages of over 3.2k would
	cause an all-out guru. This was simply due to no checking of
	string size limits.

*	Reworked the internal user parameter editor. Now more intelligable.

*	Re-ordered the internal setup process of AMUL. This simply means
	that memory allocation etc are done FIRST before trying to
	connect to AMan. This is a step towards having Screen/IO drivers
	implemented as TASKS run by AMan to reduce AMUL code size.

*	Fixed a bug in the BURN and DOUSE actions which was causing a
	complete lock-up of the system. Sorry about this, but I forget
	that some of my subroutines affect some of my pointers - sniffle.

*	MOVE will no-longer describe the new location if the player is
	ASLEEP - this makes things like the playroom (knock on the door)
	work better!

*	If a player is ASLEEP and his/her STAMINA CHANGES, they are NOT
	informed. This is to allow you to replenish a sleeping player's
	stamina. Good eh?

*	YAHOO! I have re-written the COMBAT code! Major points of note here:

	(a) Combat now works in TURNS rather than BOTH players attacking
	    simultaneously. The faster player will tend to get the most
	    blows in.
	(b) The rules for combat are (I think) much fairer now.
	(c) Fixed a problem whereby if you had '@xx' or '@xy' in the combat
	    sequence messages, I was <sometimes> displaying blanks <blush>.
	(d) If fighting a player with a tool assigned a specific STRENGTH,
	    the object will now count down it's strength! For example, if
	    you fight someone with the dish, it will break after two hits.
	(e) I have broken down the actual fighting routines so that in the
	    next release of AMUL you will be able to have SINGLE combat
	    movements, e.g: PUNCH FRED where only one blow happens.

*	Fixed several minor combat problems.

*	Fixed a problem whereby if you changed various details in Ranks.Txt
	they were not made to players accounts when the logged in after the
	game had been recompiled.... Very naughty of me, eh?

*	Solved a minor problem whereby users with ANSI codes would get the
	odd extra line-feed. AMUL now understands that ANSI codes don't
	require following with a linefeed.

*	MOBILES: I've made a simple change to the routine which calls the
	mobile. When it calls the Lang.Txt verb (e.g: !cat), it calls it
	with NOUN1 = mobile. This allows you to deal with several objects
	which have the same mobile id. It also lets you know WHICH mobile
	it was that called the routine and allows you to do various bits
	of extra trickery. OK?


                           ******* IMPORTANT *******

	IMPORTANT: System Message $14 has changed! It WAS used for asking
	whether you wanted ANSI or not. In this version it determines the
	message given when you kill another player in a fight. E.g:

	$14
		You have killed @pl!
	    or
	$14
		With your last blow you have slain @pl. You are victorious!

	IMPORTANT: In OBJECTS.TXT on a STATE LINE, the values now do:

		weight= value= str= dam= etc...

	str= is the how many hit-points the object adds to a players
	STRENGTH during a fight if wielded as a weapon and dam= is how
	many hits the object can take before it will break.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE FUTURE PLANS:

a)	Combat.Txt which lets you put far more 'pazazz' into combat by
	creating a 'multi-choice' format for the fight descriptions so
	that the combat is more interesting.

b)	New SAVE mode; allows you to save a players location along with
	the persona. Will improve single player adventures.

c)	Room parameter: SAVETO <room> which will work in conjunction with
	the SAVE command... If you have, say, a castle, and you don't want
	people saving themselves in it, it will allow you to 'shufty' them
	out when they save/exit.

d)	Single turn combat routine, allowing players to 'punch' or 'kick'
	each other, or 'stab fred' etc. Make the game a little more
	interesting.

e)	More work on mobiles. I would like to FULLY implement mobiles,
	but this presents a serious problem working on floppies - my disks
	are nearly full, so I'm REALLY struggling! I could REALLY do with
	a hard drive in some form! Perhaps someone would be willing to take
	a commercial interest in either AMUL or the running of Precious
	Days. See (f)...

f)	Accounting system to allow charging of users access to AMUL. Also
	to allow BBS SysOps to restrict the number of ID's given to a
	user. Maybe someone would be interested in sponsoring Precious Days
	as the flagship of AMUL and thus helping me speed AMUL's
	development - either a HardDrive unit for the A500 I have or an
	A600 with HD ... Maybe even an accelerator card - ANY of these
	would help!


Cheers for now!


	Oli!
