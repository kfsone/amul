Known Bugs & Peculiarities:

 * When processing a syntax where TWO VERBS are entered in one command,
   you cannot use the variable 'verb' to refer to the secondary verb, eg:
	syntax=verb verb
		treatas verb
   would generate a perpetual loop (and eventually a crash) because the
   variable 'verb' actually refers to the COMMAND VERB. Instead use:
	syntax=verb verb
		treatas noun1

 * BE CAREFUL WHEN LETTING MOBILES LOOSE ON COMMANDS! Not ALL conditions and
   actions are supported by mobiles, and they may simply result in a GURU.
   If any mobiles DO cause a guru, PLEASE report the relevant action/condition
   which caused the problem. Thankyou.
