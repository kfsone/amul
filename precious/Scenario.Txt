 Welcome to Precious Days - THE Amiga Multi-User role-playing game!
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You are about to enter a land filled with strange characters, weird places
 and sometimes fatal magic. Some of the people you meet will be REAL people,
 sat infront of a computer, somewhere... Others will be computer fakes; maybe
 a computer generated player, or perhaps a recording of another players
 session!

  Precious is filled with puzzles, big and small, but unlike a conventional
 adventure game, you don't have to complete them in order; in deed, you may
 often find that someone else has already completed some of the tasks.

  If you are expecting Precious to be a conventional computer adventure game,
 then you are vastly mistaken! The goal in Precious is to achieve as high a
 rank as possible and gain ultimate wisdom, strength and magical power. Even
 then, the fun is only just beginning!

  There are many ways to score points in Precious, and as you slowly rise
 through the ranks on your way to Master/Mistress (the top ranks) you will
 learn many of them, but few will ever learn all the secrets of Precious.

  The best way to learn Precious is to experiment. Anything you try which
 Precious doesn't understand is an ommission, and you can report it as such
 using the 'Suggest' command.

  Once in the game, there are several on-line help texts accessible via the
 following commands:

    HELP, HINTS, COMMANDS, SPELLS, LEVELS, SCORING, ACTING, COMMUNICATING

  If you have any difficulty understanding or using Precious, PLEASE drop a
 message to the SysOp of this board via E-Mail (use the [F]eedback option).

  Happy hunting!
