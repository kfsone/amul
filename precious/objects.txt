; --------------------------- Scenery Objects ------------------------------ ;

; The Doorway: This kind of object (scenery, no description) is used to make
; up for the fact that users will ALWAYS try to tinker with objects which are
; described in room descriptions ("You can leave via a doorway to the south")
; which don't ACTUALLY need to exist. Walls, winds, rivers, trees and etc
; will need similar treatment. 
; Notice that the doorway is present in several rooms.
