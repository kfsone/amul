;
; The comment line before the ranks gives you a rough idea what each of the
; fields is. Just as a reminder:
;
;	male		male-rank name
;	female		female-rank name (put = if same as male)
;	score		minimum score to attain this rank
;	str		default strength
;	stamina		default stamina
;	dext		default dexterity
;	wsdm		default wisdom
;	exp		level of experience achieved
;	mag		magic points given initially
;	g		maximum grammes carried
;	obj		maximum no. of objects carried
;	pkill		points for killing someone of this level
;	task		Task required to achieve this level
;	prompt		Default is '>' - prompt for a command input
;			(note, if the prompt includes a space, use quotes)
; To put a space in a rank name, use an underscore (eg Bold_Hero)
; If female-rank = male-rank, put '=' in the female rank (unless you WANT to
; type it out in full again)
; To put a space in/after a prompt, place quotes around the prompt.
; * MAX LENGTH OF A PROMPT IS 16 CHARACTERS *
;
; Note: You are quite free to change the values to your own scaling. AMUL
;      basis its calculations on percentages. IE, a level 6 player has
;      50% of the experience of a level 11 player.

; Foot note:
; ~~~~~~~~~
;  Most people seem to have difficulty understanding all the above suite of
; measures, so just to clear it up:
;
;	strength    muscle power; ability to move things about
;		    affected by: weight of inventory
;		    affects:     hit-power during a fight
;	stamina     endurance; staying power, your ability to continue.
;                   if this reaches 0, you die.
;		    affected by: injuries in fights
;		    affects:     dexterity - as stamina decreases you become
;				 more sluggish
;	dexterity   agility/skill/speed; speed of reflexes.
;                   Dexterity is affected by just about all parameters:
;                      blindess greatly reduces dexterity
;                      deafness reduces your responsiveness
;                      invisibility (miuntely) reduces dexterity
;                      strength/stamina/wisdom/experience affect it
;                      local lighting affects dexterity
;                      being crippled ZEROS stamina
;                   affects:	 hit power during fight (if the shot is inacurate...)
;				 chances of hitting opponent in fight
;                                chances of defending self in fight
;	wisdom      AMUL makes no use of this, but it WILL affect dexterity
;	experience  AMUL makes no use of this, but """"""""""""""""""""""""
;                   it will also be used by the 'magic' and 'spell' actions
;	magicpts    Amount of magical power player has for casting spells
;
; These definitions are STILL a little obscure to explain wholly to the
; novice AMUL user what they all mean, but as you begin to develop your
; own games, they will become clearer.
